// In version 13, Next.js introduced a new App Router built on React Server Components,
// /which supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

// File Conventions
// Next.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:

// layout	Shared UI for a segment and its children
// page	Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible
// loading	Loading UI for a segment and its children
// not-found	Not found UI for a segment and its children
// error	Error UI for a segment and its children
// global-error	Global Error UI
// route	Server-side API endpoint
// template	Specialized re-rendered Layout UI
// default	Fallback UI for Parallel Routes
